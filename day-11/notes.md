perform each monkey's operation on it's own number for X rounds, what's the number of times the value was divisible? given: { value: 2, divisor: 3, operation: old + 5 } then 2 + 5 = 7 (n)  7 + 5 = 12 (y)  12 + 5 = 17 (n) 17 + 5 = 22 (n) 22 + 5 = 27 (y) 27 + 5 = 32 (n) -> n, y, n, n, y, n so after 6 rounds, operationCount = 2, and the value = 33

to keep the value down without losing any information, you can modulo the value by the divisor each time. 2 + 5 = 7 (n, %3 = 1)  1 + 5 = 6 (y, %3 = 0)  0 + 5 = 5 (n, %3 = 2) 2 + 5 = 7 (n, %3 = 1) 1 + 5 = 6 (y, %3 = 0) 0 + 5 = 5 (n, %3 = 2)-> n, y, n, n, y, n, same pattern, and the mechanics of the problem should be apparent now

to use this across multiple 'monkeys', the valid space for the numbers needs to be a section of the numberline that repeats the same way for each divisor in the set, eg. the product of all divisors. The operation actually doesn't matter. So with{ v: 2, d: 3, o: +5 } & { v: 3, d: 4, o: *2 }, you can modulo the output by 12 and both monkey's patterns will still repeat accurately, even if you trade the value between them at arbitrary intervals, because any remainder of 12 will still be the same remainder of any individual monkey's divisor
